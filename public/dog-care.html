            <h2>General Dog Care</h2>
            <p>As a dog owner, it's essential to understand and meet your pet's basic needs. Whether you're a novice pet parent or an expert, you'll need to set the stage for your new pup. Your dog's basic needs will consist of nutritious food, water, treats, toys, and bedding to make the pup feel right at home. When you bring a new dog into your home, it's best to make a trip to the vet as soon as possible. Your vet can help you pinpoint the right type and the amount of food and other important things you need to know about caring for your new friend.</p>

            <h3>Monitor food consumption</h3>
            <p>Pet obesity is on the rise, with an estimated 50% to 60% of pets in Canada being diagnosed as overweight or obese. According to the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, weight control and management is the number one thing a pet owner can do to increase the length and quality of their pet's life. Unfortunately, overweight canines are susceptible to many health risks such as metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, or poor immune systems. While you may want to spoil your pet, avoid spoiling them with food.</p>

            <h3>Provide sufficient water throughout the day</h3>
            <p>All dogs need to have clean and fresh water available at all times of the day. Make sure to replenish the water and wash all food and water dishes so they don't hold bacteria.</p>

            <h3>Schedule annual check-ups with your vet</h3>
            <p>One of the best ways to keep your pet healthy is to visit the vet regularly so they can examine your dog for any health concerns.</p>

            <h3>Maintain proper vaccinations</h3>
            <p>Vaccinations help protect your dog's body from invasive diseases. Standard canine vaccines usually include parvovirus, distemper, rabies, and canine hepatitis.</p>

            <h3>Brush your dog's teeth</h3>
            <p>While often overlooked, dental care is also essential for maintaining your pet's health. Regularly brushing your pup's teeth can help prevent dental illnesses that can end up affecting your dog's kidney and liver function. Dental cleaning might also be recommended, but it can cost a few hundred dollars to $1,000, depending on your location. Some pet insurance companies, such as Desjardins, have dental illness coverage that includes dental cleanings.</p>

            <h3>Exercise your dog every day</h3>
            <p>Regular exercise promotes bone, joint, muscle, and organ health. Walking can also eliminate boredom and provide mental stimulation. You can also create an exercise routine with your pet, such as climbing stairs, going for a hike, or running around the backyard. While different sizes and breeds of dogs require varying levels of exercise, creating an exercise routine with your four-legged friend is essential.</p>

            <h3>Challenge your dog's brain</h3>
            <p>Man's best friend benefits from mental stimulation. Teach your dog new tricks, play new games, and create puzzles. Since dogs have a heightened sense of smell, they love using their nose to explore. Try scattering a few treats around the home for your dog to find.</p>

            <h3>Consider a microchip</h3>
            <p>If your dog becomes lost, a microchip can help you locate your pet. Microchips are painless to implant and contain your contact information. They can usually be scanned at animal shelters and veterinary offices.</p>

            <h3>Prioritize one-on-one time with your pup</h3>
            <p>Dogs flourish on love and affection from their owners. Prioritizing daily interactions with your pet strengthens your bond. You can do so by petting, playing, and giving your dog treats.</p>
